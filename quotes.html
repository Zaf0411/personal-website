        Don’t expect that you’ll be able to take in everything you need to study quickly and without difficulty. 
        Give yourself the time to take small steps and divide big topics into smaller chunks. 
        You’ll learn something new every day, which means you’re making progress every day.- Satya Nani</td>

       Mastering a skill means putting in the time and effort it takes to become good at something. 
       It’s easy to see a master at work and forget that it took hours of work to get to that level.
        If you set your mind to it and train or study hard, you can learn any skill you want.</td>

        Starting your day with a positive attitude towards learning and your life of study can be an enormous help to make your day in school or university go smoothly.
        Just a few minutes of reflection and writing down one positive thought in a gratitude journal every day will gradually form a more positive outlook.
        You might not see the effects immediately but if you tend to worry, try it and see the difference it can make to your day.</td>

        It takes courage to follow your own path and generate opportunities for yourself, but there are ways to do so.
         Always be on the lookout for new opportunities that help you to move your studies along.
          If you find a topic hard to understand, find a study group to help you or be proactive in going to extra tutorial sessions.</td>

           Sometimes exams or essays might not go as planned and you find yourself mulling over what you should have done better over and over again.
            This is a waste of your brainpower and time. Instead of thinking about what you did wrong, 
            write down lessons learned and apply them to your next project. 
            This way, you can move on and make things better next time. </td>

        Every day you start a new day you get the chance to improve and learn something new. 
        Sometimes it’s easy to fall into a pattern of a better tomorrow when you keep pushing a project or studying for an exam to the following day.
         To seize the day, see what you can do today to improve your world.</td>
